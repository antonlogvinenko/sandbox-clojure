Clojure sources presented in this project pursue several goals:
1. Playing with basic Clojure features (learning purpose)
2. Collecting and grouping Clojure features I encounter in various sources (project may be used as a reference)
3. Those who are new to Clojure may use the project to overview the language
   or find out details on specific topics.

All features are documented as simple Clojure tests.

If you find a bug or want to note something I would appreciate that.

Thanks.
